## Overview

Neutra Contracts provide the core on-chain logic for privacy-focused decentralized applications. The contracts are written in Solidity and designed to be secure, modular, and compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains.

## Features

- Solidity smart contracts compatible with EVM  
- Modular architecture for scalability and upgradeability  
- Privacy-enhancing mechanisms (zero-knowledge proofs, encrypted data handling, etc.)  
- Comprehensive automated tests  
- Deployment scripts for local and live networks  

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later recommended)  
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)  
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) (included in dependencies)  
- An Ethereum wallet/private key and RPC URL for testnet/mainnet deployment
